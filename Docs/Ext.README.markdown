The FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search user script allows you to search for profiles on [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/) by age, sex, location, sexual role, sexual orientation, profile bio (a user's "About Me" section), listed fetishes, what they've entered for "Looking For," and much, much more. This user script implements and then extends what is, as of this writing, the [most popular suggestion in the FetLife suggestion box](https://fetlife.com/improvements/78):

> Search for people by Location/Sex/Orientation/Age
>
> Increase the detail of the kinkster search by allowing us to narrow the definition of the search by the traditional fields.

With the FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search user script installed, a few clicks will save hours of time. Now you can find profiles that match your specified criteria in a matter of seconds. The script even lets you send a message to the profiles you found right from the search results list.

**This edition of the FetLife A/S/L Search script is an enhanced, extended version with full support for all genders and designed in a way that makes it immune to FetLife's recent automatic banhammer.**

FetLife A/S/L Search (Reborn Edition) is the easiest, fastest, and *safest* way to search profiles on FetLife. It's ad-free and free-of-charge. The code is open source and the service is maintained solely by donations. If you like this script, [consider donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=SW2KSKTYMY686&source=url) to support me in making continued improvements. But even if you don't donate, you'll still be able to use every feature, forever, 'cause that's how I roll.
